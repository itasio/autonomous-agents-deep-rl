# autonomous-agents-deep-rl
Project for the course of Autonomous Agents in TUC ECE fall semester of 2023-2024.

Deep Q-Network is used to create an agent for [gym-cellular-automata](https://github.com/elbecerrasoto/gym-cellular-automata) Forest Fire Bulldozer.

9x9 and 84x84 grid sizes have been tested.

Results for 9x9 are promising, but the fact that the grid size is small and the fire simulation ends quickly makes it hard to get significant performance improvement.

Results for 84x84 show that DQN agent achieves far better results than the random agent.

Checkout the results and the analysis in the [report](../Autonous_Agent_Full_Report.pdf).
